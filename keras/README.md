This is an implementation of this tutorial: https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/

Note that you will need to download the sample data and update the keras_first_network.py file to reflect its location

Create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv`  
Activate it using `source venv/bin/activate`  
Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
Then run the sample file by executing `python keras_first_network.py`
